## Welcome to Craft and Calculated

This website is made with the goal of helping you find the perfect beer for you. 

Many people say beer isn't for them, and that is fair. But maybe they just haven't found the beer for them or have a misconseption of beers.
When people hear IPA they think white guy with a beard and tattoos drinking something extremely bitter and cloudy.
This is not what craft beer is! (I mean it kinda is but there's so much more to discover!)
