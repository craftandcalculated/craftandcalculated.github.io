My first review! Wow am I excited for this. I find this to be the most fitting since this is one of my favorite beers and one of the first breweries I went to while in Hamilton. [Collective Arts](http://https://collectiveartsbrewing.com) makes a sweet and refreshing and pairs perfectly with a sunday evening sunset (as the name of the cider indicates). I think this is one of the best ciders I have ever had an I encourage everyone to give it a go! [Here's what it looks like!](https://www.instagram.com/p/CC6ewfyFIno)
