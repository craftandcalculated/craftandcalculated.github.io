	<h1>About me!</h1>
	<p>If you are someone other my mom reading this then welcome. My name is Martin and I am a Master of Computational Sciences and Engineering Candidate at McMaster Uninversirty.</p>
  	<p>I completed my undergrad at McMaster as well with a Bsc. in Mathematics and Statistics.</p>
	<p>I am interested in epidemiology and disease modelling by trade, but in my time off I am often found watching sports or hanging out with friends having a beer.</p>
	<p>I love beer and started out my craft beer journey by having a friend invite me over to a brewery for a game of chess. Maybe that was his strategy to win but he had me convinced that craft breweries were the coolest place in the world. My goal is to try and show as many people as I can how cool something so simple like beer can be.</p>
