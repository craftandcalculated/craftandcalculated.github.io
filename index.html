	<h1>Welcome to Craft and Calculated</h1>
	<p>Whenever I try to get my friends to come have a drink with me they always tell me how beer is not for them. Fair enough but I think there is a beer for everyone and they just don't know it yet. Most people stay away from craft beers with the preconcieved notion that they are extremely bitter and are only for hipsters. My goal is to hopefully find something that everyone will like! We are currently building the interactive tool to help you find the perfect drink for you!</p>
